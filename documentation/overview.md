# DevSecOps Platform – Project Overview

## Objective

This project demonstrates a production-grade DevSecOps platform that automates
security enforcement across the entire software delivery lifecycle — from source
code to runtime.

The system ensures that insecure code, vulnerable dependencies, misconfigured
containers, and unsafe Kubernetes manifests never reach production.

## Key Outcomes

- Security enforced as code, not manual checks
- Automated CI/CD security gates
- Kubernetes hardened with Zero Trust principles
- Runtime threat detection with real-time alerts
- Audit-ready security evidence and documentation

## Technology Stack

- Backend: Python (Flask)
- Containers: Docker
- Orchestration: Kubernetes
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- Security Tools:
  - Gitleaks (Secrets)
  - Semgrep (SAST)
  - Trivy (Dependencies, Images, K8s)
  - Syft (SBOM)
  - Falco (Runtime Security)

## Target Audience

- Security auditors
- Cloud & DevSecOps teams
- Freelance clients
- Interviewers & recruiters
